            "\nThis is a solo adventure for the Call of Cthulhu game. It is a\nhorror story set in the 1920s where you are the main character,\nand your choices determine the outcome. It is also designed to\nlead you through the basic rules of the game in a gradual and\nentertaining fashion. Although most such adventures are played\nwith your friends, this one is just for you.\nBefore you begin to play, make sure you have a copy of the\nCall of Cthulhu Seventh Edition Quick-Start Rules, and a blank\ninvestigator sheet. You can download a printable investigator\nsheet, or an interactive PDF version of the sheet, as well as the\nQuick-Start Rules from www.chaosium.com. You’ll also need\na pencil, an eraser, and some roleplaying dice.\nYou don’t need to read the rules before you start playing. Just\nsettle in a comfortable chair before a roaring fire. Then read on\nand follow the instructions.\n…On second thoughts, don’t sit too close to the fire.\nNow go to 1.",
            "\nThe sun is high in the sky, a merciless ball of heat. You feel\nscorched by the time you reach the bus halt in front of Osborn’s\nDrug Store. It’s a relief to put down your heavy cases and take\noff your hat for a moment. You fan your face. It has been a long\nsummer here, in your hometown, and yet a curiously empty one.\nYou look across the street, at the grubby butcher’s shop, the\ngrocers with its faded awning, and the shabby tobacconist.\nMistrustful faces glare at you as they pass, eyeing your clothes\nand luggage. It was your parents’ choice to live here, not yours.\nYou were happy down south as a child, among Providence’s\nwhite-walled houses and leafy churchyards. Perhaps this new\njob in Arkham will supply the change you need.\nYet everybody you know in the world lives here. You know\nnobody in Arkham, not one soul. You ask yourself one last time\nif you are doing the right thing.\nThe answer is here. None of your supposed friends have come\nto see you off. You are alone. Whatever challenges lie in Arkham,\nit will be a new life, and a brave one.\nA small gray motor coach approaches and rattles to a stop.\nYou put your hat back on and pick up your cases.\nGo to 263.",
            "\nYou put up a spirited resistance, but the man’s bulk and\ndetermination wear you down. Finally he lands a crushing blow\nand you drop. Blackness floods in.\nLater, you are dimly aware of your legs being lifted and your\nback scraping against the ground as you are dragged off.\nYou may restore 1 hit point. Now go to 108.",
            "\nYour morning exertions have left you hungry. You roam the\nstreets of Emberhead looking for sustenance. There is nothing\nresembling the busy cafés of your hometown, or anything that\nmight be called a restaurant.\nIt is beginning to look like you will have to get supplies from\nthe general store when May Ledbetter comes down the street\nwith a girl trailing in her wake. This must be Ruth. As she notices\nyou, she races past her mother and approaches you with a smile.\nThis is a different Ruth from the shy creature of last night.\nAs she reaches you, she stops and stretches her arms up in\ncelebration. She looks up into your eyes. Abruptly the smile drops\nfrom her face and she looks several years older.\n“Get out before the festival,” she hisses. “Get out!” She blinks\nhard, then scuttles back towards her mother.\nMay approaches, wrapping an arm around her daughter’s\nshoulders. She smiles. “How are you getting on? Have you found\ntransport?”\nStartled, you explain the frustrations of the situation.\n“I’d try Mr. Winters in the village hall. He’s always in of an\nafternoon. You’ll be hungry by now? Help yourself to any food\nin the house. The door’s not locked.”\nYou glance at Ruth where she has squirreled herself behind\nher mother’s leg. Her eyes implore you to silence.\nIf you ask Ruth about what she said, go to 9.\nIf you ask May about what Ruth said, go to 15.\nIf you say nothing, go to 22.",
            "\nAfter a moment, you hear footsteps inside the house. A bolt is\ndrawn back and the wooden door swings open. A figure with loose\ncurls and a rough-looking housedress peers at you. Her gaze takes\nin your traveling suit and your cases. Her voice has a slight Irish lilt.\n“Hello. Should I take it as you’re looking for a room for the\nnight?”\nYou enquire as to her rates, suppressing a grimace. As far as\nyou’ve seen, the village does not offer you many alternatives.\n“Oh, you’ll find them very reasonable,” she says. “You look\ntired. I’m May. Come inside and we’ll talk over a cup of tea.”\nThe Ledbetter house feels cramped, with a low ceiling and\nsimple fittings. But it is well kept and a cheerful fire crackles in\nthe grate. The aroma of the tea is soothing and the cup warms\nyour fingers.\n“Have you come to Emberhead for the festival?” asks May.\nTo explain what happened with Silas and the coach, go to 14.\nTo ask about the festival, go to 21.",
            "\nThe beasts fan out around you and black fear rises in your chest.\nOne darts close, snapping and hissing. You lash out with a foot.\nIt pulls its head back with a snarl of hatred. Their thick musk fills\nyour nostrils as they circle, waiting for the moment to strike …\nThe animals ignite around you.\nYou stare as they go up like candles, red and purple flames\nlicking their fur. Those terrible eyes stare through a curtain of fire,\nflesh, and fat consumed by the unnatural blaze. And they howl,\ntheir hunting calls twisted into a fierce dirge of pain.\nYou turn away, gasping in the thick fumes, haunted by the\nshrieks of the beasts as you grope through the young trees. Your\nvision blurs, swims. Your legs are weak—\nLose 1D3 Sanity points. Go to 13.",
            "\nYou wander the streets of Emberhead without any particular\ndestination in mind. The village is built on a relatively flat upland\nwith splendid views. To the north, the hazy tips of the White\nMountains reach for the heavens; to the south, the sparkling\nwaters of Lake Winnipesaukee touch the horizon.\nThe village itself takes less than five minutes to cross from\nedge to edge. You arrived on the winding road to the west. The\nonly other road leaves to the south, following a lower ridge of\nland as it turns east. In the southwest of the village, an open\ngrassy space borders a ruined church, its graveyard cresting the\ncliffs. To the northeast, the three main thoroughfares meet at a\nraised black metal structure. It looms, stark against the blue sky.\nYou may now:\n—Ask about transport at the local general store: go to 16.\n—Seek out the village hall: go to 84.\n—Walk down to the lower level and check out the eastern road:\ngo to 115.\n—Examine the large metal structure: go to 57.\n—Explore the church: go to 34.\n—Look for local people with their own transport needs: go to 96.",
            "\nAs you approach the southern road that descends to the lower\nridge, you see four villagers blocking the route, with farm tools\nand clubs. You veer off and head towards the west road. Your\nheart sinks as you see exactly the same scene at the other exit\nfrom the village. You are trapped.\nTo try to talk your way past one of the guard groups, go to 119.\nTo try to slip past in disguise, go to 125. Or … do you know\nanother way to leave the village?",
            "\nThe driver smokes and watches as you drag your cases to the\nback of the motor coach. The rack is set inconveniently high on\nthe vehicle. You get a grip on the heavier case.\nIf your SIZ is 40, go to 23. If your SIZ is higher than this, go to 38.",
            "\nYou crouch down and ask Ruth what she meant.\n“It’s scary at the festival,” Ruth says. “It’s bright and hot and\nthe flames go all over!” Her face and voice are both childlike.\nThis abrupt shift is disturbing. You suppose all children do\nunfathomable things.\nMay rolls her eyes and tousles her daughter’s hair. Ruth looks\nat the ground.\nGo to 22.",
            "\n“Through your sacrifice the village will be reborn,” says the first\ndancer.\n“You pass from earth to air for all our sakes,” says the second.\n“I’ve weakened the chains,” says the third. “Don’t try to escape\nuntil the flames are high enough to hide you.”\nYou stare at the third dancer. In that inky visage you clearly\ndiscern the frightened features of Ruth Ledbetter.\nTheir dance weaves off and disappears behind the buildings.\nGo to 18.",
            "\nThe village hall overlooks the lower north ridge of the village. You\nwalk along Silbury Street to find it, conscious of the oppressive\nblack metal structure framed at the end of the road. The shutters of\nthe hall are open and some windows left ajar. There is no knocker,\nbut a little bell over the entrance tinkles as you push the front door.\nInside, a sturdy door to your right is marked PRIVATE. To\nyour left, an opening leads through to a bright room. You take\na few steps inside. Benches line the walls and there are two\nnoticeboards mounted between the windows.\nTo examine the noticeboards, go to 17.\nTo knock on the closed door, go to 24.",
            "\nYou sidestep and slip out of the workshop. As the artisan follows,\nyou swing the door into his face. He staggers back, a hand to his\nnose. You take the opportunity to flee. You can investigate further\nif you would like. But perhaps it would be wiser to leave town.\nYou may check-mark the small box beside the Dodge skill. Go to 120.",
            "\nThe skin of your face feels warm. There is a mattress beneath\nyou. You blink against the sunlight. A blurred figure swims in\nyour vision.\n“You’re awake. It’s May. May Ledbetter.”\nYou shift and pain wracks your body. You feel bruised, and\nyour head throbs. May comes into focus.\n“You’re lucky to be alive. A farmer found you in the small\nhours, lying by the road. Patched you up and brought you back on\nhis cart. Said you were in the middle of the woods somewhere?\nBest take it easy today. I’ll look in on you later.”\nThe farmer and his cart are long gone, of course. You snooze\nfor a little longer.\nYou have received First Aid while unconscious and may restore\n1 hit point. Now go to 64.",
            "\nMay shakes her head and you glimpse a moment of deep-seated\nanger in her green eyes.\n“He always drives too fast. Thinks the road is made for him\nand him alone. He hit a mare some years back, that was a terrible\nthing. You should have seen the state of the coach. You’d be\nsurprised at the damage done.”\nShe sips her tea and gazes past you, into the corner of the room.\n“With living here, though, we can’t afford to antagonize the\nman. He’s about the only link we have to the world at large. And\nhe’s not a bad soul at heart. I suppose that going the same route\nfor fifteen years makes a man careless. You have to forgive him.”\nMay goes silent for a long moment. Then her eyes flick back to you.\n“But you didn’t come here to listen to me blather, and you must\nbe hungry. I can rustle you up a bit of stew. How would that be?”\nYou ask again about her rates, and May names a price so\nlow you accept it without hesitation. The room is small but\ncomfortable, and the stew dark and hearty. After dinner, you\nhave a couple of hours before your usual bedtime.\nTo talk to May some more, go to 31.\nTo walk around outside and get your bearings, go to 75.\nTo turn in for an early night, go to 63.",
            "\nYou ask May why Ruth wants you to leave town. She gives her\ndaughter a hard stare. Ruth looks at the ground.\nMay says, “Ruth doesn’t like it when we have guests in the\nhouse. But she needs to learn that we don’t always get what we\nwant in life. Sometimes we have to do things we might not best\nlike. But they’re necessary, all the same.”\nMay shakes her head at you and then nods back in the direction\nof the house. You catch a hint of emotion in those green eyes.\nGo to 22.",
            "\nThe general store is on a corner beside the main road, just before\nit plunges to the south. The shopkeeper is a brisk, immense lady\nwith a starched apron and strong shoulders. She looks hard at\nyour unfamiliar face.\n“Transport? There’s a motor coach comes through twice a\nweek. Missed it? Hmm. Truck brings in my supplies every second\nTuesday, but he’s not due until next week.” She shrugs.\nIt seems Emberhead is content to keep its distance from the\noutside world.\nYou have enough money to buy one or two inexpensive everyday\nitems here. Note them down on your investigator sheet. Remember\nthe year is 1927! The shop stocks no weapons except a dusty hunting\nknife, which you may purchase if you want.\nThen go to 25.",
            "\nThe floorboards creak beneath you as you cross the room. You\nfeel a slight spring in your step. Perhaps this room is used as a\ngymnasium for the village children.\nOne noticeboard appears to be for the adults of the community,\nand one for the children. The former looks neglected, featuring\nhandwritten advertisements for household items and a yellowed\nnote about telegraph pricing. There is nothing about the festival.\nThe children’s noticeboard has a schedule for weekly crèche\nservices, and a number of paintings obviously done by the children\nthemselves. Most are incoherent, though colorful. As best you can\ntell, they depict fireworks, or perhaps the tale of Joseph from the\nBook of Genesis. One has lost a pin and hangs upside down. It shows\na giant bird attacking Emberhead. Or it might simply be that the\nartist has not yet mastered the subtleties of scale.\nMake a Spot Hidden roll. If you succeed, go to 30. If you fail,\ngo to 37.",
            "\nAs you arrive beneath the beacon, ten villagers close in on you.\nWorking with surprising coordination, they immobilize you and\nlift you up the blackened iron stairs to the raised platform. You\ncannot help but shiver at the sight of the central framework,\ntwisted from past blazes, and what you can now clearly see to\nbe fastening points for chain. None of the eyes meet yours as\nthey lash you to the metal.\nThe village sings now, something rhythmic and ancient, carved\nfrom odd syllables. A second group ascends to the Beacon,\ncarrying the three red-draped bodies. With reverence, they\narrange their burdens in a triangle around your feet. Then they\nwithdraw, leaving you alone with the dead, shin-deep in a sea\nof kindling.\nGo to 33.",
            "\nYou block May’s exit and demand to know what is really going\non. You see real fear in her eyes.\n“It was nothing,” she says. “Just something to help you sleep.\nFor your own sake. Tomorrow will be such a big day for you,\nyou see ...”\nYou press your advantage, demanding a full explanation.\n“Please,” she says. “Understand. I’ve my daughter to think of.\nI already lost my husband.”\nShe wriggles around you and flees to her room.\nYou may check-mark the small box beside the Intimidate skill.\nTo secure your door with a chair and get some sleep, go to 58.\nTo stay awake all night, go to 52.",
            "\nThe artisan sniffs, trying to clear his nose of blood. He seems to\nslip in and out of consciousness. You loom over him, threatening\nfurther violence unless he talks about the bodies.\n“Just … villagers,” he rasps. “Died … natural. We save them\nfor … the Festival.”\nHis eyes close and his head lolls to the side. You can close\nhim up in the workshop while you think about your next move.\nGo to 120.",
            "\n“Well now, I suppose the festival is about the only reason folks\ncome to Emberhead. I thought you had maybe come to study it\nor take photographs. Well, it’s not tomorrow night but the night\nafter. I suppose it looks very strange to a passer-by.”\nMay tops-up your tea. The spout chinks against your cup.\n“We’ve got the Beacon, you see. One night every year there’s a\ntorch-lit procession and we light the Beacon on the cliffs. You’ve\nnever seen the like of it. They say it keeps the spirit of the village\nalive for another year. It’s a celebration. A celebration ...”\nShe tails off for a moment, and blinks.\n“But you didn’t come here to listen to me blather, and you must\nbe hungry. I can rustle you up a bit of stew. How would that be?”\nYou ask again about her rates, and May names a price so\nlow you accept it without hesitation. The room is small but\ncomfortable, and the stew dark and hearty. After dinner, you\nhave a couple of hours before your usual bedtime.\nTo talk to May some more, go to 31.\nTo walk around and get your bearings, go to 75.\nTo turn in for an early night, go to 63.",
            "\nYou take your leave of the Ledbetters and head towards their\nhouse. The door opens easily. In the low kitchen you make a\nmeal from stodgy bread and leftover stew. A little window offers\na view to the mountains.\nIf you learned one thing this morning, it was that Emberhead’s\nstreets hold little to occupy the visitor from out of town. But\nthere are still about five hours of daylight remaining. You could\ntake some provisions and the bare essentials from your luggage,\nand set out in the hope of reaching another settlement before\ndark. Or you could ask advice from this Mr. Winters.\nIf you prepare and walk out of town, go to 28.\nIf you head to the village hall instead, go to 11.",
            "\nYou struggle for a few seconds before the driver comes up beside you\nand lends a hand, still puffing on his cigarette. “Heavy bags for a small\n‘un,” he remarks. You judge it best to respond with a simple thanks.\nGo to 233.",
            "\nYou raise your hand to knock on the door, but it opens before you\ncan complete the movement. The middle-aged gentleman behind\nit takes an involuntary step back, adjusting his spectacles. You\nhasten to apologize and introduce yourself. He steadies himself\nand peers at you.\n“I see. I’m Clyde Winters. Just visiting, you say? And you’ve\ncome to see me? Hm! Care for some coffee? I usually take a cup\naround this time of the afternoon.”\nHis invitation seems genuine enough and a good opportunity\nto ask any questions that are on your mind.\nGo to 43.",
            "\nYou are beginning to get your bearings in Emberhead. Would\nyou like to explore some more?\nYou may choose another option from those below. Do not repeat a\nprevious choice. Once you have tried four options (or before that, if\nyou are ready to move on), go to 3.\n–Ask about transport at the local general store: go to 16.\n–Seek out the village hall: go to 84.\n–Walk down to the lower level and check out the eastern road:\ngo to 115.\n–Examine the large metal structure: go to 57.\n–Explore the church: go to 34.\n–Look for local people with their own transport needs: go to 96.",
            "\nYou drift awake in the morning light. The sun is already high\nbut you do not feel well rested. You find yourself preoccupied\nwith little details of the room: the wood grain of the doorjamb,\nor a chipped handle on the wardrobe.\nAs you swing out of bed, your stomach gives a lurch and you\nlean too far over, nearly tumbling to the floor. You blink for a\nmoment. Perhaps you have an illness coming on. You get carefully\nto your feet. The air in the room is heavy and fragrant. You stare\nout of the window until you feel steady enough to leave.\nYour skill rolls today suffer a penalty. Roll the “tens” percentage die\ntwice and take the higher result. This does not apply to Luck, Sanity\nor damage rolls.\nNow go to 64.",
            "\nThe door scrapes, wrenching you\nback into the moment. Orange light\nspills into the house from blazing\ntorches held at the threshold. Two\nlarge villagers step in and grab you. At\nleast, you assume they are villagers. They\nwear heavy black cloaks, and their faces and hands\nare painted entirely black, save only for a red triangle centered\non their left eye.\nYou try to drag your legs, but they reach under your arms\nand lift you bodily from the bed. Outside, it seems that the\nwhole village has congregated to see you. Every single one has\na blackened face with the red triangle motif. Torches sputter\nand spill fire.\nYou struggle, but you can see physical resistance is hopeless. You\nare marched to the central street and turned to face the Beacon.\nGo to 117.",
            "\nYou take money, water and some sandwiches. It seems polite to\nleave May Ledbetter a note explaining the situation and that you\nwill return for your bags as soon as possible. The sky is flecked\nwith cloud but shows no sign of imminent rain.\nA couple of villagers watch as you descend on the southern\nroad and follow it around to the east. The black metal structure\nlooms on the promontory above. You shiver as you pass the lower\nhuts and head out of Emberhead.\nAfter the miserable, enclosed streets of Emberhead, you are\nrefreshed by the open air and sense of progress. An hour later,\nhowever, the empty road ceases to be a novelty. You have just\nentered the first patch of woodland when you hear an eerie,\nlilting howl from the north.\nMake a Natural World roll. If you succeed, go to 35. If you fail,\ngo to 41.",
            "\nThe northern side of the village is bustling and you are unlikely\nto remain hidden there for long. You head in the direction of\nthe church, and then move up the east side, behind the houses.\nA drop looms on your right. One particular section of ground\nis quite narrow and you have to hug the building for support.\nYou may give this approach up and go to 120. To proceed, compare\nyour SIZ to your DEX. If your DEX is higher, go to 42. If your\nSIZ is higher, make a Natural World roll. If you succeed, go to 42.\nIf you fail, go to 36.",
            "\nAs the afternoon sun hits the floor you notice something curious.\nThe boards under the windows are newer than the boards in the\ncenter of the floor. The frames also show signs of having been\nreplaced in the recent past. Perhaps rain leaked in and rotted\nthe wood.\nYou may check-mark the small box beside the Spot Hidden skill.\nNow go to 37.",
            "\nMay talks about life in Emberhead. “In her letters my sister\nalways asks if I’m not bored, living in such a small place. She\nlives in New York. Then she writes about how frightened she is\nto walk home at night! I ask you.”\nYou mention your hopes for a new life in Arkham. May doesn’t\nseem to hear you.\n“It’s a small place here, yes, but that means we have real\ncommunity. Everybody’s face is known. Everybody works\ntogether. Nobody is excluded. Except those who choose to\nexclude themselves, of course. I couldn’t live anywhere else now.”\nMake a Charm roll. If you succeed, go to 39. If you fail, go to 51.",
            "\nAnger flashes in May’s eyes. “Would you strike a woman in her\nown house?” she snaps. “Eighteen people live on this street. If I\nscream, every one of them will come running.”\nShe scrambles from the guest room and into her bedroom.\nYou consider pursuing the issue, but decide against it.\nTo secure your door with a chair and get some sleep, go to 58. To\nstay awake all night, go to 52.",
            "\nIt seems the entire village is gathered around the Beacon to watch\nyou burn. Behind the face paint, you recognize May Ledbetter,\nand—yes, that is Silas the coach driver standing at her side. The\naudacity and scale of the deception staggers you.\nA man steps up on a dais and raises his hands with quiet authority.\nThe frame of his spectacles obscures the red triangle on his face.\n“So we draw here together again on this night, as we do each\nyear, and we give thanks to the one who will preserve the village\nagainst the fire of the void. You will be taken by the Ones From\nAbove in our stead. Your death will bring life to our streets and\nbounty to our fields. It will safeguard our children and our elders\nalike for another year. We salute you.” He bows his head.\nAll around the Beacon, bearers step forward and lift their\ntorches to the edge of the raised platform. A ring of tiny flames\nflicker up around the perimeter. As they wink, the singing of the\nvillagers drops into an unearthly rhythm.\n– To throw all your remaining strength against the bonds, go to 44.\n– To wait and see what happens, go to 40.",
            "\nYou cross the street towards the church. As you glance to your\nleft, your gaze alights on the large metal structure. Something\nbothers you about its positioning. You back up and look again.\nYes! Emberhead’s central thoroughfare points directly at the\nstructure. This seems too precise to be a coincidence.\nYou press on and draw into the shadow of the church. The\nbuilding is in a sorry state. The top of the steeple is missing, a\nragged gash of splintered boards marking its absence, and the\nfloors beneath it have collapsed. It appears to have torn through\nthe roof of the main building as it fell. Only the back half is\nstill intact. The white paint, which once covered the church, has\nyellowed and peeled.\nIt seems safe enough to explore the rear section. Old pews\nare stacked against the wall, choked with mildew. Most of the\nwindows are broken. You guess this church has been disused for\nabout twenty years. There is little more to interest you.\nMake a Ride roll. You may have a bonus die; roll the “tens”\npercentage die twice and take the lower result. If you succeed, go to\n46. Otherwise, go to 25.",
            "\nThe call is that of a coyote, common in this area. The sound can\nbe frightening, particularly at night, but coyotes have learned to\navoid humans. You can proceed without fear.\nYou may check-mark the small box beside the Natural World\nskill. Now go to 54.",
            "\nThe turf crumbles beneath your feet and the edge of the cliff\ncollapses. Your stomach lurches as you feel yourself drop.\nMake a Climb roll. If you succeed, go to 48. If you fail, go to 55.",
            "\nThe door scrapes behind you. A middle-aged, bespectacled\ngentleman appears in the doorway. “May I help you?”\nYou explain you are visiting on May Ledbetter’s\nrecommendation.\n“Ah. Well. I’m Clyde Winters. I’m not sure I can help you,\nbut … would you care for some coffee? I’m partial to a cup in\nthe afternoon.”\nHe gestures to the open door behind him. This seems like a\nworthwhile opportunity, and you are a little thirsty.\nGo to 43.",
            "\nThe driver continues to enjoy his cigarette, watching with keen\ninterest as you struggle with the cases. You grit your teeth and\nheave the second one into place. Perhaps the residents of Arkham\nwill have better manners.\nGo to 233.",
            "\nAs the hour wears on, May’s upbeat manner descends into\nsomething more reflective.\n“It’s not always easy. I’m a widow, you know. We have a little\nmoney, and of course I appreciate the custom of travelers like\nyourself. I know we’ll never starve as long as we live here. But I\ndon’t see myself marrying again. I know every man in this village.\nI know them too well, if you see what I mean.”\nHer mouth twists briefly, then she yawns and pushes a hand\nthrough her hair.\n“Time for me to turn in. When would you like your breakfast?”\nOn your investigator sheet, check-mark the small box to the left\nof the word Charm. If you successfully complete this adventure, you\nwill have the opportunity to learn from your experience with May.\nNow go to 63.",
            "\nThe flames snake across the kindling, catching and rising. Smoke\nrises and it becomes difficult to see the villagers. The three bodies\nsurrounding you catch fire, blazing with sooty red flames. You\nbegin to cough as the smoke enters your lungs, and fight down\nthe urge to panic.\nIf you have learned a strange chant and wish to try it, this is the\nmoment. Otherwise go to 65.",
            "\nYou hesitate. You have grown up in the familiar landscape of\nthe town. Wild animals are a little outside your experience. Is it\nunwise to head on into the unknown by yourself?\nTo press on, go to 54. To return to the safety of Emberhead, go to 47.",
            "\nThe turf sinks beneath your feet and stones crumble from its\nedge. Alarmed, you grip the building and ease yourself forward.\nFinally you have a good spot to watch the Beacon.\nGo to 61.",
            "\nYou step through the door marked PRIVATE. The other side of\nthe village hall is in marked contrast to the public space.
